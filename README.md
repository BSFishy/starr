# Starr

Library for interacting with APIs for:
-   Lidarr
-   Sonarr
-   Radarr
-   Readarr

This library is still reasonably featureless and could use more time and energy.
It is currently used for a [small CLI app](https://github.com/davidnewhall/unpackerr)
that just extracts torrent downloads.

Can be easily expanded by adding more structs and methods to `Config`. It could
also use a `Get()` function to return an interface.
